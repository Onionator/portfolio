          <h2>My name is <span id="name">Sam Cook</span></h2>
          <p>I am currently a student at Epicodus learning how to write code. I have been learning to code off and on for the past couple years, but I decided it was time to go full time and move towards the career that I want.</p>

        <h2>I am a Ford guy</h2>
        <p>I have been running my own business buying, selling, and restoring classic cars and trucks part time for the past 7 years. It’s more of a hobby than a business, but it’s a hobby that pays for itself. I have had the pleasure of working on 23 different vehicles so far and I’m sure I’ll double that number before I’m 30. While each vehicle is different I can definitely say I have owned mostly Ford F100s of which I current own 5. That said I only have one that is currently road ready… for now.</p>

        <h2>I enjoy being outside</h2>
        <p>Whether I’m biking, hiking, or longboarding I always enjoy being outside. I can’t go a day without doing something outside or at least cruising around the country with the windows down in one of my classics. My favorite time of year is Fall because I like all the colors and the bite in the air when you're flying down a hill at <em>30 mph<em> on a longboard. I use to just bike for fun, but now it's my main mode of transportation.</p>
